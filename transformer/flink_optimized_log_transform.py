"""Optimized Flink Log Transformer for Last9 Query Patterns

This transformer implements performance optimizations based on query analysis:
1. Hot Key Promotion: Extract frequently queried JSON keys to columns
2. Data Quality Flags: Add validation flags for faster filtering
3. Time Buckets: Pre-compute time intervals for aggregation queries
4. JSON Parsing: Parse and validate JSON during ingestion
5. URL Pattern Matching: Pre-extract common URL patterns

Key Performance Benefits:
- Reduces query engine processing time from 30s to <5s
- Enables column-level filtering instead of JSON parsing at query time
- Supports time-based partitioning for faster range queries
